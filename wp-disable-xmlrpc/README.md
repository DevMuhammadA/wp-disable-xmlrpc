# Disable XML-RPC (WordPress)

Lightweight plugin to disable XML-RPC endpoints and reduce brute-force/pingback abuse.  
- No settings, activate and done.  
- Do **not** use if your stack (e.g., Jetpack/remote publishing) requires XML-RPC.

## Installation
1. Download as ZIP or clone into `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate **Disable XML-RPC** from **Plugins** in WordPress.

## Why
XML-RPC is often targeted for brute force and pingback amplification. If you donâ€™t need it, disable it safely.
